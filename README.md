Problem Statement: Explore a dataset, frame interesting questions, and gain insights through basic data analysis techniques.
Tasks:
#1 Dataset Exploration and Preparation:
Load the provided dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand the structure of the dataset (e.g., rows, columns, data types).
Visualize data distributions using basic plots (histograms, bar charts).
Identify missing values or outliers and discuss potential impacts on your analysis.
Framing Questions and Gaining Insights:
Develop interesting questions you want to answer using the dataset. For example:
What factors influence a particular outcome or variable?
Are there patterns or trends in the data over time?
How do different variables relate to each other?
Use your questions to guide your analysis and identify key insights from the data.
Data Cleaning:
Address missing values using methods like imputation or removal.
Standardize or normalize data to make it suitable for analysis.
Convert categorical variables into numerical formats if necessary (e.g., using one-hot encoding).
Basic Analysis and Insights:
Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) to understand the data's central tendencies.
Use Pandas and NumPy for basic data manipulation and answering your framed questions.
Create visualizations (scatter plots, line graphs) to explore relationships and trends in the data.
Introduction to Predictive Modeling:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Apply simple predictive algorithms such as Linear Regression or Decision Trees.
Evaluate model performance using basic metrics (accuracy, MAE, etc.).
Relate your modelâ€™s findings back to the questions you framed.
